After passing an unexpected challenge on entry you find yourself finally within the main floor festivities. Gaudy masquerade masks mocking those who have been enslaved by their “controlled programming” masks. Laughing in spite of the humans just down the hill being treated like mindless drones. Trapped while their bodies feel every waking moment of their painful labors.
It’s rough out there, but you wouldn’t know it from the whimsy within the ballroom.
Conversation pools and dives, an ocean of people present to have it. But you pick out one whirlpool from the riptide, centered on a round suited man with a collective of interested parties gaggled around him.
If anything it’s a place to get started. He might even be your guy.
You join the foaming throes of prissy aristocracy and listen begrudgingly as the babble about nothing and everything. Tuning your ears toward the center of the jabbering, you hear nothing of interest what-so-ever.
