# LovelyMasqueraid

Godot VN game made with Dialogic for GGJ '26

## Game Premise

You are a spy. Seduce your way through a masked ballroom of high profile “suitors” to uncover the secrets behind–and eventually take down–the top-secret facility beneath the surface of the seemingly innocent masquerade. The real party doesn’t start till you take the dance floor, and you plan to take it. By storm.
